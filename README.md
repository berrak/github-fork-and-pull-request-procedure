# How to fork a repository, handle incoming pull requests (PR), and set up GitHub Pages

These documents are written so I have quick access to Github forking and, the pull request procedure. Maybe someone else will find these useful as well. Mastering the forking procedure is important since you can contribute and, give back to the open source development.

## Some useful aliases to configure in '.gitconfig'

This is my git configuration file, i.e. '~/.gitconfig' when working with git. The other common git commands I use is 'push', 'pull' and 'fetch' and, they are pretty self explanatory and do not need any aliases.
